This version of zsim is modified for research into properties of cache. More specifically, we compare per-\/line cache clusion property with the overall cache clusion property that is typically implemented for most caches, i.\-e. inclusive, exclusive or non-\/inclusive.

Scripts \-:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item run\-\_\-spec.\-py -- this script runs all spec benchmarks using zsim. It takes arguments using the sim.\-cfg file which specifies the properties of the simulator.
\item run\-\_\-parsec.\-py -- this script runs all the parsec benchmarks, or the particular one specified using the sim.\-cfg file which specifies the architecture configuration.
\item run\-\_\-graph500.\-py benchmarks -- runs the graph500 benchmarks
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The outputs of these benchmarks is a set of metrics that result from the simulation, including power metrics that are obtained from Mc\-Pat.
