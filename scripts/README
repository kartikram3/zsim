We have a set of scripts and subscripts.
The output of zsim's simulation should be in a 'results' subfolder
inside the particular folder the config file is located in.

This means we also need to add some path information in zsim's source code.
Right now the path corresponds to the default path. This path needs to be fed in
as an argument in the config file. It can be automatically obtained by the python 
script that runs the program.
