For non inclusive and exclusive llc, we need to lock the lines after an inner level search, otherwise, they
might become invalid due to an eviction by the other thread. In this case, we would have a problem because
invx would set it to shared.

To overcome this, we have modified the processInval function coherence_ctrls.cpp so that it sets the state to S
only if the state is not I.
