Need to run pinballs with zsim so that outputs are reproducible. However, we cannot run
gdb so development will be done with pinballs disabled.

So config script needs to have 2 options :

      a. Run process executable.
      b. Run pinball.

We also need to decide what language the script will be written in  --
      a. perl
      b. python
      c. shell
